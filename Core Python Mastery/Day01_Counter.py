# ðŸ§  Objective:
# Develop a Python script that reads a given text  and analyzes word frequency using the `collections.Counter` class.
# This is a fundamental task in text processing and forms the basis for more advanced applications like search engines,
# chatbots, and natural language processing (NLP) systems.

In the age of information, data is everywhere.
But raw data alone is meaningless â€” itâ€™s the patterns, the insights, the questions we ask of the data that give it value.
Python, being a versatile and powerful language, enables us to extract this value efficiently.

Can you count how often each word appears in this paragraph?
Letâ€™s find out â€” and remember: case, punctuation, and repetition all matter!
