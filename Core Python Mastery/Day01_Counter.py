# ðŸ§  Objective:
# Develop a Python script that reads a given text file and analyzes word frequency using the `collections.Counter` class.
# This is a fundamental task in text processing and forms the basis for more advanced applications like search engines,
# chatbots, and natural language processing (NLP) systems.
